So there you go
You can do it on your own
Can't see who you are
Never let a dream go cold
Even when you're losing hope
The dreams you've been dreaming were right, now's the time
You're so unfair to yourself
Hold on, don't let go (Unstoppable, unstoppable)
Never let a dream go cold
You know it's about you
If you feel it in your heart, it's all about
You build up these monsters, they're just in your mind
It's all about you
It's always about you
If it's playing in your car, don't turn it down
I can still see the road ahead
'Cause you're unstoppable
I know you're full of doubt
Hold on, don't let go
Climb away 'til they're gone
It's all about you
You know it's about you
Now you're closer than you think
Rising higher than the sun
Don't quit, keep on hoping
If you feel it in your heart, then sing it loud
I know the feeling like you'll never win
Hold on, don't let go (Unstoppable, unstoppable)
You just gotta know (gotta know)
Guess it's why I wrote this song
You just gotta know (gotta know)
But don't let them bring you down
You know it's about you
Even in the dark, you glow (Unstoppable, unstoppable)
It's always about you
I can still see the road aheadI know you know who you are, so sing it loud
Hold your head up high
Every time you fall
They'll never bring you down
Every time you falter
And you'll see how radiant you are
Never let a dream go cold
I know you're full of doubt
Shining brighter, you're unstoppable (Unstoppable, unstoppable)
Climb away 'til they're gone
Guess it's why I wrote this song
'Cause you're unstoppable
Every time you fall
So there you go
Way up above the clouds
But don't let them bring you down
Climb away 'til they're gone
So there you go
You know the right words, they're all in your head
Guess it's why I wrote this song
And you'll see how radiant you are
Every time you falter
Shining brighter, you're unstoppable
I know you know who you are, so sing it loud
And you'll see how radiant you are
It's always about you
But don't let them bring you down
Unstoppable
Your heart's in the washer, your head's in the spin
Rising higher than the sun
It's always about you
But sometimes believing is all that it takes
You'll be brighter than the stars
They'll never bring you down
I know you know who you are, so sing it loud
You can do it on your own
Got that feeling in your chest
Way up above the clouds
Guess it's why I wrote this song
'Cause you're unstoppable
You know it's about you
If you feel it in your heart, it's all about
Guess it's why I wrote this song
Unstoppable
If it's playing in your car, don't turn it down
Yeah you are
You know it's about you
Guess it's why I wrote this song
I know you're full of doubt
You know it's about you
Even when you're losing hope
You'll be brighter than the stars
'Cause you're unstoppable
Wanna be somebody else
Rising higher than the sun
It's all about you
Even when you're losing hope
It's always about you
Way up above the clouds
On the edge of giving in
You just gotta know (gotta know)
I know you know who you are, so sing it loud
They'll never bring you down
UnstoppableCan't look in the mirror
You'll be brighter than the stars
It's always about you
Even in the dark, you glow
You can do it on your own
So wake up in the morning and get out of bed
'Cause you're unstoppable
If you feel it in your heart, then sing it loud
It's all about you
'Cause you're unstoppable
You try and you try, but you can't catch a break
Hold on, don't let go
Growing tired of where you've been
